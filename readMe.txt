Dear Sir,


This is the solution to your exercise.

The exercise looks simple, once I started coding it became complexer and funnier.

I made use of interfaces for behaviours and use of concrete classes that implement those.

I followed the specifications when coding. As a change I made sure that each animals keeps at least one friend,
so any of them is not lonely. Of course, in the beginning none has friends.

The launcher program is AnimalFarm, use it to get a feeling of the solution.

I provided tests for this application.

One thing I dealt with was consurrency when removing data from the set of friends.

An improving to the tests might be to test it under concurrancy race conditions.



Thanks.
